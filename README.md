# ShellCal

This is an iCal calendar manager for you shell inspired by [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/). It aids with the generation and management of iCal formatted files within a folder heirarchy.

This initial version of the application will be written in BASH, but if it proves itself useful, I will rewrite it in RUST.

#### Use Case

This script itself just manages a directory, but if combined with git, it can become a distributed calendar repo. If then hosted on the web, you can point a many different iCal clients to sync off of one server.

#### Running

It is a shell script. Make it executable and point the shell to it.

Usage information shown in application with the `--help` flag.
